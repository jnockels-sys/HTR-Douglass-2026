This repository includes data from an AHRC-funded International Placement Award, between the University of Edinburgh and Library of Congress. The project focused on making the autobiographical writings of Frederick Douglass (1818 - 1895) more accessible through AI-enabled transcription workflows, as well as contributing to analyses of his work.
