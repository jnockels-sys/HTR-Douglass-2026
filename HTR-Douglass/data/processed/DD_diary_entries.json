I had\nthought to cross the ocean quietly and without\nbeing recognized by anybody , I ever saw before, but\nthis notion was soon dispelled for I was soon\napproached by Rev Henry Wayland son of the late\u00a0\nBllelock\nPresedent Wayland and by mr George Bllelock\na gentleman I knew nearly forty years ago as\u00a0\na Boy. Both Gentlemen greated Helen and myself\ncordially and expressed pleasure at having us\nfor fellow passengers. At breakfast we found ourselves\nopposite to mr and mrs Chandler. Mr Chandler\nhad heard me speak on the Assassination\nof Abraham Lincoln in Rochester and had\nnot forgotten the impression. Our voyage will\nthus evidently not be one of solitude.\n\n\nseveral letters came on board and were handed to me\nafter our voyage began and we were well on our\nway to the gates of the sea and unfortunately\nthe pilots left the ship too soon to permit of\u00a0\nsending a word of answer or a word of fare\nwell to many dear friends to whom it would\nhave been a pleasure to have sent such a word.\nWe have now been on this noble ship about\n8 hours and no sign of the dreaded trouble\u00a0\nof sea sickness. Had two or three short talks\nwith mr Breelock and mr Wayland. The latter\nis a remarkable clever talker and is a\nman very free from pretense but I fear\nis a little biased in his politics by Mugwampism.\nI like him. We have but few few passengers\nand of them there is a large springling of\u00a0\nladies, most of the latter thus far have spent\ntheir time on deck in steamer chairs\nwith Books began peacefully closed on their\nlaps more as oran ornaments than for\nuse. While the men walk the deck and\n\n\nsmoke, smoke and smoke, looking as solemn as\nif they were on the way to a funeral. We have\nnot been on this steamer as I have said more than\n8 hours and have already had two fare meals\nand have the promise of two more before the\u00a0\nday closes. I have not yet found out who\nthe captain, but like a true yankee our Helen\nhas made the acquaintance of the pilot and\nhas seen the Captain Monroe. Everything\nbetween officers and men seem to go an very\nsmoothly. Commands are calmly given and\u00a0\npromptly obeyed. In the calm where we are\nnow are, a young man, is persistently boring our\nears by playing on an organ that stands at one\nend of the dining saloon. The passengers toward\neach other exhibit the usual reserve at this\nthe beginning of the voyage, with air of\nindifference about the presence of each others.\nThey will show more interest as the days\nroll on and half of them shal feel the\nthe grip of the sea sickness.\n\n\n. The City of Rome is said to be the largest except\nthe Great Eastern. She behaves beautefuely\nin pleasant weather, but it remains for us\nto see whether she will gain this credit\nin a storm."

February. In company with a large and pleasant party\nheaded by Rev J.C.

It was\na day long to be remembered. That which interests me\nmost was the fact that I was looking upon the country\nseen eighteen hundred years ago by the Prisoner apostle\non his way to Rome to answer for his religion. It\nsomehow gave me a more vivid impression of the\nheroism of the man as I looked upon the grand ruins\nof the religion against which Paul dared to preach.\n\n\nThese heathen Temples represent a relegion as sincerely believed\nin as men now believe in the Christian relegion and Paul\nwas an infedel to this heathen religion as much as\nRobert Ingorsol is now to the Christian Relegion\nThursday 3d.. 1887\nWas a day spent in comparative quiet. We needed to rest\nfrom the labors of the previous day -\u00a0\nFriday 4. Jan. Another brimful day. In company with mr Fletcher\nwho knows this region about the Bay of Naples by heart. we went\nto Pompeii distroyed in the year 79. by the ashes and lava of\nVesuvius. I was told in Rome that there was little to see in\u00a0\nNaples. but it was almost worth the voyage across the\nAltantic to see the part of Pompeii already unearthed and\nto think of the two thirds of it still underground. All\nthat has been said and written of this buried city is\nexceeded by the city itself. It speaks to us of the age and\nbody of ancient times with a power and vividness\nwhich holds us in breathless and thoughtful attention These\npompians some of whose forms at are exhibited in\u00a0\nthe musium were wealthy and powerful slaveholders. and\u00a0\nsurrounded themselves with luxuries which surpass\n\n\nin some respects those of modern civilization. The magnificence -\u00a0\nof their dwellings. the splendour of their Temples. the extent of\ntheir amphetheatres, the costliness of their decorations in\npaintings and sculpture, the arrangements of their\nbaths. cold and warm tell of vast wealth, marvellous\u00a0\nthought and still. The vanity of all efforts in this line\nin enforced with tremendous emphases as we walk amid\nthese vast ruins and feel that was what we see a are\nonly one third of what lie still buried under the ashes\nashes of the still smoking mountain well we see in\nthe distance.\nSunday Febry 6. Attended U.P Church in the morning. Heard a sermon\non Balaam by Rev. Mr Erving- rather a memorable discourse. Dined\nwith Mr Gutheridge an English Gentleman. In the\nEvening listened to Mr Jones who preached in Italian\nat the methodist church - I was called upon for\na few words at the close. wich were interpreted\nby mr Jones. I congratulated the congregation\nthat they had now the liberty to worship outside\nthe Romish church and said a few words of\nhuman Brotherhood.\n\n\nFebry.monday 7. We go to day to Amalfi in company with mr and\u00a0\nmrs Murray from Sidney Australia. The ride is said to be one\nof the most delightful of any of this surpassingly charming Bay of\nnaples. The Rev J.C. Fletcher is to accompany us.\n\u00a0Tuesday 8 8.\nWe have found the ride to Amalfi. more delightful and more\nimpressive than any description of it of written or spoken. The\nroad must have taxed ingeneering skill to the utmost, They\nWho built it had to fight against sea and land - against\nheights and depths above and below. and solid rocks in\nfront. The road is an ingeneering triumph. and affords\none of the finest rides in the world. The towns along the\nroad side. with their terraced gardens of lemons and oranges\nseem rivitted to the bold over hanging rocks to keep them\ntrembling headlong into the sea. Some of the curves in the\nroad in order to over come the steeps and depths take\nthe form of a horse shoe the heels of which come close\nto each other and makeing the impression, that we were\ntravelling in a circle. The view of the sea from the road\nis a constant delight to the eye. Little and large\nvessels dot the whole coast with thin white sails &\noppose their attractions to the many pleasing lights that\n\n\ninvite attention to the mountains along whosebase we ride,\nAfter reach Amalfi. We had the greatest heat of all: a ride upon\nDonkees, to the Capuchin Convent. once the house of the capuchin Monks.\u00a0\nyesterday\nWednesday Febry 9th We went to far famed Paestum- passing through\nSelerno - a beautefully situated town on the coast. the fine white\nbuildings of which were seen long before we reached it on own\nway from Amalfi. At Pestum Paestum we saw the celebrated\nTemple of Neptune built seven hundred years before the birth of\nChrist. and here it stands to day. in stately and solemn grandeur.\nimpressive by its loneliness as well as by its enduring perfections.\nTwenty five hundred years have shaken their hoary locks over\nits majestic form - and sunshine and storm have honey\ncombed its massive walls and pillars - yet there it stands\nand is likely to stand a thousand years hence. It has seen\nPerish\nPompeii and Herculanium rise and fade. It has seen Rome\nrise and its decline and fall. and a new relegion wax &\nmay\nwane.

On board the steam ship ormuz. bound for Egypt\nThis morning at eight O.Clock Helen called me to the Bullseye\nto catch my first view of strumboli, a volcanic mountain\nconical shaped - abruptly from the sea. There were white\nclouds about its base, but the morning light rested upon\nits summit - and made be it, beautiful, soon after this\nthere loomed in the distance the mountainous shores of\nSicilily - and those of southern Italy. Messina on the one\u00a0\nhand and Carigio on the other - and the straits between them\nin front of us. It was a deeply interesting spectacle - and\nthe morning was well fitted to heighten the effect - I could\nbut congratulate myself that born as I was a slave marked\nfor a life under the lash in the cornfield that was abroad\nand free and priveleged to see there distant lands\nas full of historical interest and which those of the most\nhighly favored by fortune are permitted to visit. \u00a0I find\nmyself much at case on this streamer. I am known to\npassengers and officers and all alike, seem to wish to\nmake my voyage pleasant to me. It is now blowing\n\n\npretty hard and our good ship is trembling about on the sea -\u00a0\nin a manner which makes it hard to write. We did not\nget a glimpse as we hoped in passing Sicily, as far famed\nEdna. We were told that it was hidden by the clouds. We\nhope for better luck on our return.\nMonday 14. Febry. If right in my estemate of the length of time\nI have been in the world, I am now 70 years old. Aside from\na cold and a little hint of sea sickness, I am quite well strong\nand cheerful - This is a trying day for Helen and many other\nladies on on board. The wind is strong and the waves run\nhigh. Few of them seem ready for dinner. My case\nis better than most. For I am able to go at the sound\nof the Bell. I am a little surprised at the wild\nbehavior of the medeteranian. I expected better things of\nher. To night I saw the light on the Island of Creet -\u00a0\nI suppose there was no light there when Paul\nsailed along its coast. It is strange that starting\nlife where I did - and old as I am that I shd.\nbe planning this classic sea and on any way\u00a0\nthe\nto the land of Moses and Pharoahs. where\nJoseph and his brothers went for corn and Jos :\u00a0\n\n\nwas treacherously sold by his brothers into slavery.\nTuesday. 15. Febry. The wind has fallen and the sea has gone down\nHelen is well on her feet again. We hope to be in port Said\ntomorrow morning. Our morning which began bright is now\nover cast with heavy clouds, and the Baromitre is going down.\nMany are writing home this morning to be mailed I suppose\nat Port Said - as most of our passengers are bound to Australia.\nNotwithstanding English reserve I am not at a loss for all the\ncompany I want I answer reserve with reserve, and approaches\nwith approach. my friends are one of the ship owners\nW.G.\nmr Anderson and mr and mrs Murray - real hearty\nand sensible people. Miss Borden from Fall river is on\nboard and is going up the Nile. She is a great traveller and\nis very agreeable. Five months ago this morning on\nthe deck of the City of Rome Helen and I bed fare\nwell to the Shores of America, but with expectation\nof finding our way to Egypt and I dare not\nnow say how much further South and East we\nshall go before we turn our faces homeward -\nsuch is life !\n\n\nWednesday Febry 16. 1887. Arrived at Port Said: the queerest of\nqueer places. the enterance to the Suez Canal. All nations\nare here represented. a place to study Ethnology. Our ship\nis just now coming to the wharf. forty or fifty small\nboats have already surrounded the ship and their inmates are\nlike\nclamouring, wild fowl of every possible note to the passengers to buy\ntheir oranges, lemons figs and other fruit. soon several\nscows loaded with coal to the waters edge to coal our ship\nfor her further voyage. They are soon boarded by a\nperfect swarm of Arab laborers. frocked, hoeded, or fezed\nbarefooted and barelegged to the knee, to bring in baskets\non their heads the coal on shipboard. Heavens! what a\u00a0\nwild clamour - what a confusion of tongues, all going\u00a0\nat once and each endeavoring to drown the voice\nof the other. but the work goes bravely on. and one\nis astonised at the strength cheerfulness and\nendurance of these Sable children of the desert\nI saw among them several genuene negroes and\nthey seemed not a whit behind their fellow workmen\neither in noise or physical ability. When our\ncoal was in we moved on silently down the\n\n\nthe canal towards Ismalia. But through what a barren, and\ndesolate land do we thread our way ? Not a blade of grass - not a\ntree - not a single dwelling - no sign of human life for or\nanimal life, except a distant row of Pelicans looking on the plain\nlike a line of foam on the shore of a sea. On, on we go\nslowly and noiselessly on a narrow stream of pure blue\nwater, cut through the wide waste of sand - broad whose\nlimits lie far beyond the rag range of vision. Night comes: and\nwe anchor till morning since we are not permitted for reasons\nof safety to proceed in darkness - The stillness of the day is\ncontinued in the sight and made more impressive\nby the darkness that has fallen upon the desert -\u00a0\nMorning came morning came warm and bright - and\nwe proceed on our way. Our steamer is followed for miles\nby a little boy screaming for Bacheese\u00a0- No sign is given as to\nwhere he came from or were he will go. It looks as\nif he had risen out of the sand. The passengers - through\nhim bread and oranges. He pockets them in his scanty\nclothing and runs on as if nothing has been given\nhim. The amazing thing was that he never was satisfied\nwith his gains nor tired of his running.\n\n\nThursday Febry 17. Ismalia: \u00a0We reached this place about 12 miday - too late\nfor the train to Cairo - and must remain here till tomorrow. We were\ntaken a shore from the Ormuz buy a small steamer - and have\nde\ntaken lodging for the night at the Hotel Des Bains der mer\na small, but good food at three dollars per day - I hardly think\nwe can see in any part of Egypt anything more Egyptian\nin the manners, customs and appearance of the people\nthan we see here. We saw to day a caravan of camals\nbearing their burden over the sand. It vindicated the truth\nof many pictures of this side of Eastern life - We saw\u00a0\nseveral veiled woman bearing jars of water on their heads just\nas woman probably did in the days of Abraham. The\nmarket house here is quite worth seeing - even though\nwe shall see larger ones of the same kind when we\nshall reach Cairo - E Ismalia is a new town spung up\non the prospect open by the Suez Canal. The conditions\nfor growth is not favorable. I saw a greek patriarch\nwalking a flowing robe here to day wearing a peculiar\ncap. I find it hard to look wit patience upon people\nwho thus parade their religion in their clothes. and\nwho evedently wish to exact homage on account of such\npretentions\n\n\nFriday 18 febry. We quietted Ismaila to day at 13 o.clk\nfor Cairo - and a six hour run brought to our destination.\nThis ride will not soon be forgotten. It was through the\nBible famous land of Goshen. - For the most part a land\nof unequalled firtility of outspread fields of green vegetation\nand of flourishing and picturesque palms - Here we saw\nthe same kind of a plow used two thousand years go - for the people\nhere like the laws of the Medes and persians, change not - Everything\nwe see remainds us of the days of Moses. I do not\nknow of what color and features the ancient Egyptians were -\u00a0\nbut the great mass of the people I have yet seen would\nin america be classed with mulattoes and negroes -\u00a0\nThis would not be a scientific discription - but an american\ndescription. I can easely see why the mohomitan religion\ncommends itself - to these people. for it does not make color\nthe criterion of ch fellowship. as some of our so called\nChristian nations do. All colors are welcomed to the\nfait of the prophert - I am stopping at the New Hotel\nso called. Pretentious on the outside, expensive, but not\nwell kept. I got my first glimps of a pyramid to\nday as we approached Carao Cairo by the train.\n\n\nIt was a little disappointing, but I will wait for a nearer view.\nSaturday Feb. On our arrival in Cairo - we were met in the\nFriday is the Mahomites Sunday\nstreet by a grand holiday ^ procession which block the street\nso completely that we were unable to go on for nearly the\nhalf of one hour. On patience however was rewarded by\u00a0\nseeing the Khedeive - and having from him a gracious\nbow - and what is better to see the struggling, jostling noisy\nand eager mass of his turbined subjects pushing there way\nbetween carts, carriages, donkeys and carriages at risk\nof life and limb. We could not have a better chance of\u00a0\nseeing an Egyptian crowd - Though noisy and without\nform, utter chaotic, it was good natured - each one took\nthe push of his neighbor without offense. The officer that\nendeavored to clean the way for the Khedeive used a\u00a0\nwhip instead of sword or Bayanet - The sound of\nthe whip upon some of the long skirts was sharp\nand loud, but no body was hurt.\nSaturday febry 19. Called upon Mr Cardwell - the american\nconsul General. Was very courteously received by him -\u00a0\nvisited two Mosques\nWe were not allowed to enter, without putting sandals so that\n\n\ninfedel shoes shd not touch their sacred courts. We saw several washing\ntheir feet and afterward kneeling and kissing or touching the floor\nwith their foreheads. In one respect these Mosques are\nto be commended. They have no images of or pictures of saints\nor God. make no effort to personify Deity.\nVisited the tombs of the mamelukes. and on our way saw\nvarious forms of squaler desease and deformity - all\nmanner of importunate begging. It was truly pitiful\nto see a people their grovelling in filth and utter wretchedness.\nWe also visited the Bazars - where all manner of fabrics are\nmanufactured and sold. Here men were smoking, worker\ntheir long pipes drawing the smoke through water - and selling\nor rather offering their ware wares for sale. The most\npainful feature met with in the streets are the hooded and\nveiled women. It is sad to think of one half of the\nhuman family should be thus cramped, kept in ignorance\nand degraded - having no existence exempt that of ministeray\nto the pride and lust of the men who own them as slaves\nare owned. and who like and worst is they seem to\nlike to have it so.\n\n\nSunday Febry 20. Attended and spoke a few words to the Sunday\nscool of the U.P. Church mission. It was good to see in\nEgypt about two hundred of these people assembled to\nrecieved instruction from mr and mrs Harvey - both americans\nEgypt that gave knowledge to western Europe two\nthousand years ago. was now sitting at the feet of the\nwest - and recieving instruction from a part of the Western\u00a0\nworld then unknown! From the heights of her citadel we\nGreet\nLibyan\nsee Cairo an the Lybian hills and the cheapo pyyramids -\u00a0\nThe view is very imposing -\u00a0\nMonday Febry 21. Went to the house of Dr Grant saw\nhis museum of Egyptian curiosities. called on the\ndaughters of Arch Bishop Whately who have been\nhere twenty five years teaching school: Excellent\nwomen doing excellent work.\nTuesday: 22d. In company with mr and Mrs Shankland\nwent to the Gehezeh Gizeh and climbed to the top of Cheops,\nthe highest Pyramid in the Valley of the nile. The\nheight is four hundred and seventy feet. The ascent\nis both difficult and dangerous and I would not\nundertake it again for any consideration.\n\n\nWednesday Febry: 23. Called with miss Conner on several Egyptian\nfamilies in the morning and in teh afternoon went to Hileopolis and\nsaw the famous Ostritch farm - and the beautiful obolisk\u00a0\nred\nobolisque of ^ granite the only visible remains of the once great\ncity of On.\nThursday 24. Went the Museum in Cairo. the largest\nand best assemblage of Egyptian antiquities now -\u00a0\nextant. The Room of the Mummies is startling\nwhen we think wer we ar looking at people who lived\nand moved in this Valley three thousand years\nago. In the Evening we took supper with mr. &\nmrs Harvey Missionaries . after ward prayer meeting\nFriday 25. Febry. Wrote during the forenoon\nsent one letter to mrs Crofts and one to Rosetta - In the afternoon\nwent to see the hot Howling Dervishers at worship. the Coptic\nChurch and the Jewish seynagauge _ and then took a ride on\nthe Subra Road - There was much to remind\nin the worship of the Howling Dervishers of the colored\nmethodist campmeetings in the South. There were many\u00a0\nspectators present - and the worshippers got a good bit\nof money by their queer performance, which by the\n\n\ndid not seem insincere. They evidently thought their worship\nwere pleasing to their God. One man spun around like a top\nforty or fifty times without stopping. I thought he would certainly\nfall to the floor but he did not and but after resting a few\nminutes proceeded with his whirling till the close of the meeting. Another\nman worked himself up to a perfect frenzy - jumping up &\ndown and at last fell to the floor rigid as one dead. During\nall the worship their beating on large Tamboreenes - blowing on a\u00a0\nreed instrument, a kind of chant and momentary interjection\nof recetations from the Korall - The Whole performance was sad\u00a0\nto behold - sad to think that rational being could be made to believe that\nsuch physical contortions could be pleasing to God or secure his\nfavour - yet how much better is the form of worship adopted by\nmany other denominations - and is it not strange that men should\nimagine to secure Divine favor by telling God how good &\nthey\ngreet he is and how much ^ love and adore him - God is\nglorified not by such worship. but by a spirit of obedience\nto the laws of our being as established by the Almighty and\nwritten in the very constitution of things - Burnt offerings\nincantations and muscular action - silence reason and\u00a0\ndegrade manhood.\n\n\nSaturday Febry 26: Went this morning to Mohameden College\nwhere twelve thousand pupels studying the Coron and preparing\nto teache its doctrines to the benighted sons of men. I saw\nabout two thousand of them in the court and college building\nreceding their morning lesson. They wore the peculiar dress\nand Turban of the mohamedan and presented a striking\nspectacle. If sincerity is any proof of the truth of their creed\nthey certainly give that proof but alas! sincerety is no\nsuch proof The most revolting imposture has been defended\nby equal earnestness and sincerity - The followers of the\nprophet can pray as loudly and preach to as many\nmiracles as the christian can - they even exceed the christian\nin religious attention to cerimony - We also went to see\nthe Mohamden Bible house, where you may see\nthe Coran in all languages. It is a gret\nsight Two hundred millions of people are\nsaid to receide this sacred Book. the Coran - \u00a0\nSunday Febry: 27. Attended a Presbyteran service conducted in Arabec\nin the morning. did some promenading in the afternoon\nwrote to Charley. and went to see a great tree called the Banian\nTree. The peculiarity of this tree is that its branches extend to the\n\n\nground take root and spread indefinitely -\u00a0\nmonday 28 Febry. We rode away over a delightful Road\non Donkeys the Ghezireh Palace and Gardens and\nGrotto. It well repaid the trouble though for my part\nthe ride on Donkeys among multitudes of people\nin oriental costume and crowds of camels and Donkeys\nmaking a striking of Egyptian life was to me more\ninteresting - than palace gardens or Grotto.\nTuesday march 1st 1887 This has been one of the most interesting days we\nhave spent in Egypt. This morning we set out at half past seven on a journey\nof sixteen miles three to the Railway Station for Bedrachien and\nthence six miles on the backs of Donkeys to the site of ancient\nMemphis and the necropolis of Sakar Sakkara. The Donkey ride\nwas a hard one - but the results were very satisfactory. We first came\nto the site of memphis and there we saw a paid of sculpture\nwhich suppose had no equal in the world. a statue of Ramses\nforty two feet in height - and here there fragments of broken\narchetecture and sculpture. But the chief place of interest was\nseveral miles away. It was the necropolis of Sakkara with its\nPyramids and tombs. The tombs are truly archetectural wonders -\u00a0\n\n\nWednesdsay 2d. march. Went to witness parade &\nsham battle by British troops stationed in Cairo\nThe people of Cairo were not attracted to see the fine show.\nThey are evidently not over pleased with the presence and\npower of British Soldiers. though in truth, they are probabably\nmuch better off with them than they would be without them.\nThursday 3d.. march: Went to look at Dahabiyeh incompany\nwith miss Agg. and miss Richardson. We are to go with them\nin it on use Eight days trip up the nile - In the afternoon\nwalked with Helen through Bazar -\u00a0\nMarch 11th Have just returned from a five days trip up the nile as\nfar as Beni Hassen while there were few points of special\ninterest reached during the trip the excursion upon the whole\nowing. to the general character and history of the country\nthe peculiar character of the people met with along the\nshores of the great river. the strange appearance of the\nby\ntowns. the varied scene presented the barren and desolate\nsand mountains assembling all sorts of shapes sometimes\nresembling vast fortifications and at other reminding us\nof enormous animals. made was one of the interesting and\ndelightful made during my tour abroad.\n\n\nIt is not strange that people of Egypt almost deify the Niles without\nit there country would become a barren waste. The Nile feeds\nclothes and shelters them, from it they get water to drink, water\nto bath. to wash their clothes, from it they get their fish,\n&\nthe mud to build their houses. The fertilizer to repair\nthe waste of the soil in production. It is to them the\nsource of life and whatever of health and prosperity for\nwhich its people have to be thankful. It is great highway\nover which their products find their way to markets -\u00a0\nand its bosom night and day is covered with curiously\nrigged vessels. with wing shaped sails going to and from\nCairo. Our trip was made upon a Dahhabezez. Christeaned\u00a0\nby Miss Richardson and Miss Aggo as the Meni -\u00a0\n14th.. March monday. Arrived at Alexandria stopt\nHotel Bonnard - Tuesday 15th march. Called\nupon mr Ewing Missionary also upon Judge\nJ.B. Kinsman - took a pleasant ride\nwith kind in company with Judge\nBrinkhouse afterward launched with\nthem. Saw Pompeys Pillar - and the\nsite of the Alexandrian Library\n\n\nwednesday mar: 16. Took passage on Board the Egyptian\nsteamer Sanchie. for Athens. The weather beautiful\nthe passengers pleasant and we hope for a prosperous\nvoyage. The thought of soon treading the classic\nshores of Greece is very exhilerating.\nSaturday 19th march. Have now been Athens a part of two days.\nspent the first afternoon at the Acropolis saw the city from\nits heights saw the great Parthe^on. theatre of Dyonesus the\nDionesseus, the it reputed to hold thirty thousand the\nadlium said to have held six thousand - the proportion\nn\nErecatheium - the propylaea - There was point out\nto us from the Acropolis the place of the imprison .\nof Socratees - On our way we passed the Temple\nof Jupiter of which these is now standing only\n15\na facad corinithian pillars looking beautiful\neven in their ruin..\nSaturday March 20. we have been treated to day to\none of the finest views we ever got of any country\nin the same length of time. We ascended by a\nZizag path to the top of Lycabettus 919 feet above\nthe level of the sea. I would look down upon\n\n\nthe famous city and its surroundings - and note its Che\nthe chief features of interest from the school of Plato\nto the waters salamis. It was a scene never\nto be forgotten. The Plains of Attica were spread out\nat our feet. Over the mountains, we could almost\nsee the fields of Marathon. off toward the sea\nwe could see dimly the mountains of Sparta.\nIn the City of Athens, solemn and grand with its\nmany pillars stood out the form of the Temple\nof Thesious one of the most perfect and striking of all\nthe fallen architectural ruins left to tell us the\nwealth pride ambition and power of the\nancient people of this famous city.\nThursday march 24.

I am not sure\nthat I quite concealed my surprise. but a train of events\nwhich\nflashed upon me, the impression of them was difficult to\ndrive from my face and manner. I however soon began\nto think, what do I know of this lady. that I should\nthink her otherwise, than merely holding strange\nand erronious opnions. I do not know that she\nis not in her life as pure as she seems to be. I treated\nher politely and respectfully and she departed apparently\nnot displeased with her call.\n\n\nApril 18.

    "text": "th Arrived in Florence.\nMy first excursion here was to see the grave of\nTheodore Parker in the Protestant cemetary. I found\nin the grateful shade of a cedar tree - covered with\nviolets and roses. attesting the presence of some\nfriendly hand. The brown headstone has nothing\nornamental or costly about it. The inscription\nhas only the name of the great man whose\ndast steeps below it with the date of his\nbearth and his death. I could but recall\nas I looked upon his grave, the many\nservices rendered the cause of human freedom\nby him - freedom not only from physical\nchains but the chains of superstition. - those\nwhich not only galled the limbs and torn the\nflesh - but those which marred and wounded\nthe human soul. A few feet from the\nremains of Theodore Parker lie those\nof Rechard Hildreth. another american\nwho will niver be forgotlen by those who\nhave read his Book entilted Despotesum in\n\n\namerica and the white slave. It is said to think\nthat one with such talent as Richard Hildreth\nshould have died in absolute poverty in a\nforeign, but such I am told was the fact.\nIn the same cemetary - where so many\namericans have found a last resting place\nI found the grave of E. B. Browning -\nI have inquired and laught, but\nhave not found in Florence the home\nof miss Ludmilla Ashing the sister of my\nfriend of many years miss Ludmilla Assing -\nAlas! how soon are the dead forgotten -\nand how soon we who live must be\nconsigned to the same oblivion.\nFlorence is all alive to day She is expecting\nthe arrival of her king and queen. They\nare immensily popular not only in\nFlorence all over Italy. The priests hate\nthem but the people love them. The streets\nare now densely packed with a multitude\neager to look upon royalty! yet what after\n\n\nis all the pomp and glory of kings! How soon\nmust the strongest and proudest sink. below\nthe horizon and mingle with the common\ndust of the eaarth.\nWednesday: We Helen and I went to see Prof.\nFiske in his beautiful home the former residence\nof minister Marsh. We were cordially received\nshown his Library - his study - his ground - the\nremarkable points of the environs of Florence\ninvited to stay to breakfast, and to dine at\nany time during our stay in Florence. For\nthis last our stay was entirely too short.\nFlorence is, as I intemated full of life. Her streets\nare crowded with people, her houses are adorned\nwith flags - of all colors and nationalities\nsplended equipages, with livened servants are\ndashing through the street and dazzling\nin the sunlight. Well dressed men and\nelegantly dressed ladies, are finding there\nway through orderly crowds of the common\npeople who seem to feel as much at home\n\n\nand as much at their ease as the princely\npersonages who roll by in their splended Carriages.\nThis feature of the scene gladdens my eyes.\nWe shall be here only three or four whole\ndays and I am already greibed to quitt this\ntruly delightful city -\nSunday may 15th\nwe have now been in Italy since the 10th five days of sight seeing -\nand of tumultuous enthusiasm. King Humbert and his wife, I\nshould say the Queen, are here to unveil the splended facade\nof the Duomo - the grand cathedral of Florence. We have seen\nthe ufizzi Palace with its fine pictures and statuary - The church\nof San Marco - the grand mosoleum of the medicio be and the\nTombs built by Michelangelo. very impressive are the\nfigures. we have seen the monastery of san marko - and the\nroom of salvonarola and the place where burnt to death and\nabove all we have seen the streets of Florence crowded\nwith its citizens and the peoples from the neighboring\ncities and country - and found them very like the same -\ncrowd to be seen in american cities on great occasions\nonly as I think a brief more good natured though not\n\n\nmore quiet in behavior. The Arno forms a beautiful feature of\nFlorence as the seine is to Paris. We leave tomorrow for Venice with\na feeling that our stay has been all to brief in Florence -"

    "text": "We have now spent four days in Venice,\nand two days. in melace, and have passed this\nday in Lucern. The ride from Florence to Venice\nwas delightful - The weathe was neither too hot\nnor too cold - and bright sunshine gave a lustre\nto the snow crowned Appenines and set there\noff attractions and ch imposingly. As to Venice itself\nI can only say it surpassed all the ideas I had formed\nof it. It is a city by itself. I had read of its canals, its\nGondolas - its Rialto, its palaces and its wonders of\nart and its churches - and was prepared to look upon\nall with admiration - but had after small comprehension\nof its charms. The square in front of st mark\nThat monarch churches is flancked by the Doge's\nPalace and arcades on the other once seen will\nfine\nnever be forgotten - and will always tower before\nthe mind with peculiar pleasure. In looking at\n\n\nVenice as it is with the marks of decay upon it, though\nstill in many respects the most beautiful of cities\nbut we easily think of what it must have been in\nthe days of its, when it was the city of merchant\nPrinces. and had control of the rich commerce of all\nthe East - when it was a free Republic. I saw its\nBiblotyc containing acres of volumes - and precious\nmanuscripts among these I saw letters from those\ngreat americans: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson\nand Benjamin Franklin. On the great\ncanal, I saw the house where Desdemoni reseded\nwhen wooed by Othelo. No where else than in\nVenice is glass manufactured into more perfect\nforms of beauty. Where climate, sea and sky are\nso beautiful - it is not strange that they should\nsuggest beauty to the artificers in all kinds of works -\nMilan: aside from its splended\nCathedral, is not remarkable. It is simply\na fine city with fine houses, stores, sq\nsquares - like any other fine city -\n\n\nI have spoken of the ride from Florence to Venice\nbut that was nothing in comparison with\nthe ride from milan to Lucern. Delightful\nsurprises - in mountain scenery kept our eyes awake\nand eager all the way - now it was towering snow\ncovered mountan tops, overhanging and frowning rocks\ndeep gorges looking as if opening to swallow up our\nondashing train, and now it was beautiful cascades\nleaping in dazzling splendour down the darken\nmountain side - to join some dancing stream that\nthreaded its way through depths below. Then there\nlittle swiss cottages tucked up neatly in little\nspaces. often higher up than the Eagle is won't -\nbuild his nest _ and where avalanches and Landslides\nseemed must to threaten. Every possible corner\nof earth here which gave the faintest promise\nof reward - seemed carefully tilled - Here at least\nthere are no idlers - men, women and children\nall work and even that born gentleman of\nleasure the day is seen hilping his master\nto bear his burden. Women in their red\n\n\nhead dresses, ornament the field, but and at the same do\ntheir full share with shovel and hoe. Wherever else, woman\nis denied her equal right to toil like a man here she at\nleast her equality is fully and fairly recognized.\nLucern, where I now am, has a beautifful lake at\nits feet a powerful stream receiving through it , -\nfirtile fields and gardens on oneside and cloud piercing\nmountains on the other. It is difficult to conceive\na town situated more beautifully and I do not\nwonder that it attracts in Summer a large\nconserve of visitors.\nmay 25. I am again back in Paris at the Hotel Britannique\nwrote to charley to day - called on the Stantons - and upon\nmr Tilton, the latter not home - Called upon the Lespremonts -\nand learned of the death of the dear old man the head of the\nhouse - Bought Ticket par la ville de Rome pour Helen\nmay 26: A long walk the\u00a0la rue de Rivoli -\nSunday 29 may - Was much in company with\nMr Theodore Stanton called upon senator scheolcher -\nIn parting with venerable Senator he kissed me on\nboth cheeks.\n\n\nLondon"
