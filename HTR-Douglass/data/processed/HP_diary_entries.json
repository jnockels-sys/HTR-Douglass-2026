    "text": "City of Rome.\nDrove to the pier in a hansom, from Grand Central Hotel, at 1 o\u2019clock, a\nbeautiful day, and after looking up our luggage went on board, and remained there,\nlooking over the ship, watching the loading of the vessel and visiting with friends. In the\nevening Frederick went on deck, but I was tired and undressed and mounted my perch,\nthe upper berth, and though we had pulled close on the dock and were all night receiving\nand loading freight just outside our port hole, I slept all night. As I said we went on board\nearly, eager to see our room. We found it a very comfortable little place, the space\nopposite the berths and under the window a port hole, a round eye of glass, is occupied\nby the couch. Over it and over each berth is a wall pocket and over the stationary wash\nbowl, between it and the mirror a fresh linen pocket for brushes, fresh water bottle,\npneumatic bell call, and altogether a nice cosy little place. Dr Frauenstein called the\nevening before sailing and we had a pleasant visit with him in the little boudoir\nupholstered in old gold plush and Ebony. We talked of Miss Assing, & as the genial Dr\nleft he threw his arms around Frederick\u2019s neck in a good old fashioned hug & kissed him,\nkissed me, and ran off the steamer. A cordial wave of his hat from the dock and he was\ngone.\nBut all on board was the bustle of departure. On both ends of the long steamer a\ncompany of stevedores was hoisting and lowering into the hold great loads of pressed\ncotton for English manufacture, and as night came on a queer looking box boat steamed\nalongside, and before morning emptied its contents, great quarters of iced beef, into the\nhold of our ship. I descended from my perch, dressed, & was on deck before time to start.\nThe Pilot, a pleasant calmed man of 45 yrs. passed a pleasant word with me before going\ninto the pilot house. Frederick came up, and soon the whistle soundeds. he gang plank\nwas pulled away and the mighty vessel moves quietly. These powerful tugs help to push\nher enormous length around and as she gets rightly headed separate from her and go their\nway. The pilot stays with us two or three hours, and leaves so quietly that we only know\nit when he is gone. The Captain takes charge and we are fairly committed to the voyage.\nThe ocean is as smooth as any river, and about 4 hours out takes on the dark, exceedingly\ndark blue hue, that I have never before seen. For an hour or so it has an anxious mottled\nappearance that for some time I study in vain, but finally conclude to be due to millions\nof little waves or ripples receiving the sunlight at different angles. Only 71 passengers\nlose themselves in the spaces of this mighty ship that one week ago landed at New York\nhundreds of home returning travellers, and we are told that in London are many waiting\npassage, as the books of all the steamers westward bound are filled till into November.\nOne of the passengers is Rev. Henry Wayland son of old Dr. Wayland, and as Frederick\nalready knew him it was pleasant to meet. He looks and appears as if he might himself\ncommand a ship. He is totally without appearance of affectation, and hearty and plain in\nhis manner of address, a six footer I am sure, and in a dark blue woolen suit including\ncap. Frederick and he have already had some political conversation to which I was an\ninterested listener. To me there was the smell of mugwumpery on his mental garments,\nbut it might have been ship smell. Mr. Brelock too, who with his little daughter are\npassengers, Frederick knew as a boy. He is a very pleasant man also. Just before coming\ndown to the writing table in the pretty dining saloon, furnished in dark green, we got into\nconversation with a young Englishman who has been making an 18 days visit to the\nStates and Canada.\nThe sea has been very smooth so far with but little rocking of the boats Night\ncame on and we sought our berths. I slept well and was on deck at 5 1/2 o\u2019clock by N.Y.\ntime. No one was there. The chairs had all been set in a cross passage and the decks\nwashed down which is done during the night. Soon a cheery Englishman who with his\nson a stout young man, spoke with us in the evening came on deck. Nearly opposite us at\ntable sit Mr. and Mrs Chandler, she very pretty and gentle in appearance and he low in\nvoice but with an air of quiet authority that commends him as a man not to be trifled\nwith. The dining saloon is on the lowest floor I have seen, a large pleasant room in oak or\nwhat looks like it, supported down its length by columns, the port holes or round\nwindows looking out on either side of the ship upon the broad ocean, an organ in the\nfarther End, to one side of which is the long writing table at which we, with others, write\nand at which I am now sitting. This saloon is furnished in dark green plush, 8 long tables\nExtending down the middle, with a row of short tables at either side. Part of one row of\nshort tables and part of the long table next to it, only, are occupied, as we have so few\npassengers. There is variety in the dishes and they are well selected and nicely prepared.\nThe oat meal of breakfast is as good as anything we have, that is, it is to me a standby and\ntastes good. Dr. Wayland sits way down at the end of the long table, and we are the last\nof the inside away up the room. In the passage at the entrance of the dining room are the\nstairs. Beyond in two narrow passages along the ship one Either side are state rooms, ours\nbeing No 92, on right hand passage. Over the dining room is the drawing room, or saloon,\nwith piano at further end, the middle occupied by an open space looking down into the\ndining room, surrounded by a neat railing, and containing hanging plants and two\ncanaries. Around the room are what would be settees, but that they are divided into\nsections making of them individual chairs, the color of carpet and upholstery is greyish\nand pleasing and restful to the Eye. Just outside this saloon are the decks where the\nsteerage passengers are when they wish to be outside. Above this saloon again is a lovely\nlittle boudoir in old gold plush and Ebony, and the deck on this floor is the promenade\ndeck, where most of the cabin passengers spend much of their time.",

    "text": "The second day was slightly rougher, white caps appearing. We saw seven vessels\nin all, three of which were steamers, one of which the Captain spoke (by signals) and one\nfrom Amsterdam or Rotterdam I forget which, was crowded with passengers on deck as\nwe passed, curious like ourselves to see any steamer coming so near. We had made this\nday, the 16th miles, and the Captain is directing his course rather to the northward.\nDuring the day Dr Wayland came to Mr. Douglass, urging him to give an address\nsome evening of the voyage, as he had consulted with the Captain and several passengers\nand there was a general desire to hear him. Mr. Brelock brought me a pretty Highland\nstory to read. He is of Scotch parentage. Mrs. Chandler, at table asked me about Eva\nPitts, whom she knew at Naples, and whom she greatly admired, and was much pleased\nto find me her sister. We meet often on deck. She is going abroad for her health and will\nvisit Egypt and Palestine. She has completed a four years course in art. She was Isora\nSchwartz. Her name I remembered at once as one Eva often mentioned, and her\nmarriage I partly remember, but cannot recall the particulars. To day they are testing\ntemperature of ocean by drawing up buckets ful and plunging a thermometer in.",

One of the officers Mr. Morrison came to\nus before breakfast as we were sitting on deck and had quite a long pleasant conversation.\nHe has always been on the sea, first on sailing vessels, and for four years on the City of\nRome. Such a voyage as this is the perfection of luxurious travelling. The beautiful Ever\nchanging hues of the ocean, the grand sweep of the sea, the flitting vessels crossing our\npath, and we wrapped in our easy chairs on deck, seem rather flying through the air, so\ngentle is the motion of the boat. I have had some tendency to head ache and a little\nqualmishness, but could walk or stand at any time, and have not yielded to it at all,\nmissing no meal, and am pronounced a good sailor. The wind has hitherto been against\nus, but to day is in our starboard quarter, (right side quarter) and we have four sails set.\nThese and the immense straight iron masts, and three enormous black smoke pipes\nsending their long black trail away behind them over the ocean, together with the\nexceeding length of the vessel, nearly 100 ft longer than Washington Monument must\nmake an imposing sight. A card room with liquor counter, and a reading room, occupy\nthe upper part of the boat back of the stairs leading on either side to the deck. Last\nevening Frederick and I looked into the card room where 4 men sat round a table\ngaming\u2014the first time I believe, that I ever saw it. One man I marked for a gentlemanly\nvillain, one looked like a lank American very grave and absorbed in the game. The other\ntwo seemed younger men, and I wondered how it was faring with them. An attendant, as\nwe left, brought them from the counter, a waiter with 4 glasses of liquor, and we left them\nwith each a glass in hand.\nThe English passengers, the men, interest me greatly. Young, sturdy, in rough\nclothes, generally a kind of checked suit, without superfluous sail, they have a\nstraightforward business like gait, that gets over the ground with least resistance. They\nseem so totally free from fine dressiness, so sensible in their attire, that I cannot but like\nthem.",

The day windy and late\nin afternoon huge billows begin to roll in, giving the steamer long plunging rolling\nmotion. In the morning petrels skim along and a whale showed himself which I did not\nsee. Towards night the fog came on, the decks were wet, and the whole feeling on my\npart was a kind of disgust and I would have been glad to step ashore and never sail\nanother mile on sea.\nSitting on deck Mrs Chandler and I had a long visit. She has taken a 4 yrs course\nin Art, had a large class of pupils in Portland, Oregon, has written some for papers and\npublished one book, \u201cAlthe,\u201d not connected with art, I think, but a S.S. book. She\nmeans to make this trip subservient to her art work. Then we walked the decks for a long\ntime, then Frederick and I watched the billows. After dinner we sat around the deck. I\nundertook to read in the Library, & fell asleep. Retired in time, to be awakened by fog\nhorn, which for a time kept some of the passengers anxious. Fog betokens ice.",

    "text": "383 miles.\nMorning damp but sat on deck till 10 \u00bd when English service was read by the\nmissionary from China, Mr. Groves his wife presiding at the organ. Quite a number of\nthe passengers met in the dining room but it was not very cheerful. The sining did not\nreveal great talent among the audience. One burly man I took to be English, had been\nparading the deck with two cigars from his ugly mouth. Someone asked him why two?\nIt\u2019s Sunday, he replied, and said to someone that he was going to church and was going\nto sing too. Surely enough when I went in there was Burly, and at the proper time he\nstood up right in front of the clergyman, hands in breeches pocket and sang away for\nought I know like a nightingale. Some of the young English men went through the service\nhardly looking on the book. I was not sorry when it was over. The missionary has a\nnervous affection that makes it impossible for him to preach. The poor fireman, who\nburst a blood vessel a few days ago died Saturday, and was buried at sea Sunday morning\nat 4 o\u2019clock. So we went on in the rolling waves leaving in mid ocean one who sailed out\nwith us buried before the passengers were out of their berths. I wondered if he had wife\nand child waiting for him. At 3 o\u2019clock, about equal to 12 at home, Mr. Wayland met all\nwho cared to join, in the Library, to go over the S.S. lesson of the International Series.\ndid not seem to amount to so very much but I was glad I attended. The latter part of the\nday it rained, and though Frederick and I sat out a while covered up by wraps and\nwaterproof, we were compelled at last to go in, and after sitting a while in the pretty\nsaloon where some were reading, and a few about the piano, which does not seem\nparticularly melodious, joined in singing, went to bed. The oil on the machinery and the\nwater let into the rooms give two smells that I cannot endure. The first I try to keep away\nfrom, the second I get rid of by having a pail of water brought to the room instead of\nusing the smelling water. It seems to be sour, and is said to grow worse instead of better.\nIt is condensed water, or formed by condensation and perhaps the tank is not clean.\nI do not think we have on board a very brilliant company.\nIn the morning a school of porpoise gambolled about the ship but I missed them.\nFrederick went after me to see them but when we got there they had disappeared.",

The sun has been\nshining, and the clouds rolled along the horizon in great silvery masses, much like the\nclouds we saw illumined by the sun on Mt. Washington. The morning I spent in the\nlibrary, and as I left just before lunch had a pleasant little chat with the China Missionary.\nThat burly, two cigar man, I am told is an Italian, and has a son as tall as himself, who\npolitely brought me a cup of beef tea, when it was brought on deck and passed with\ncrackers among the passengers there. This is done every morning at 11 o\u2019clock, either\nbeef tea or chicken broth.\nAt the top of the upper stairs, branching each way to the deck, is hung a map of\nthe Atlantic, with the routes marked upon it, and each day at 12 o\u2019clock our situation is\nmarked upon it, and the number of miles we have gone since 12 o\u2019clock the preceeding\nday, written down, so we may know just where we are, and how fast we are going.

    "text": "September\nTo day the passengers are eager to make good distance, and calculating the time\nof reaching their journey\u2019s end. The meeting was held in the saloon last night Capt.\nMunro presiding. All seemed interested in Frederick\u2019s little address which was over\nbefore any one was ready for him to stop. He could have spoken an hour to their\nsatisfaction, but for himself, he was saved that effort. Mr. Wayland at once sprang to his\nfeet and asked attention for a few moments, and in his strong vigorous style gave\nFrederick a few words of merited recognition. The contributions were made up to \u00a35, and\nit was decided to give it to the widow of the poor fireman. God save the Queen was\nsung and the company dispersed. I should perhaps add that we have on board a real live\n\u201clord,\u201d Lord Porchester, son of the Earl of Carnarvon, a delicate but not sickly looking\nslip of a young man, or boy, pink and white complexion, close curly hair, and face of no\ngreat strength or promise. He with his tutor, have been travelling in America, & he is\ntaking a young seal home with him. Two young men are his constant companions one a\nwealthy and pleasant fellow named King, the other I know not who or what. The tutor is\na rather severe red faced stocky, and silent man. These attended the address. Another\npassenger who interests me is an old Captain, name unknown, originally from\nPortsmouth, N.H. Been everywhere a ship can go, and though now about 70 yrs of age,\nand apparently a little tremulous, en route to Calcutta. His personal affairs he keeps\nlocked tight, but is free to relate experiences here and there. Small, thin white hair,\nbronze face, and very bright eyes, lays down even simple propositions with great gravity,\nand with constant and emphatic use of the forefinger. Mr. Chandler does not like him, but\nI do, and am ready to give him ear, and he evidently likes Frederick and me for audience.\nAccording to his story he was in the Sipoy rebellion, in the Chinese war, and\nthe Caffre war, not as combatent perhaps, but present, and he denounced them all. He\nmust have been in East India, for he has the same quiet stealthy gliding way of appearing\nand disappearing that we are told belongs to that people, and perhaps to no other. At any\nrate he always reminds me of it. He sits at table with the Chinese missionary who is\nenglish, and Mr. Blelock very amusingly relates to us his way of pinning down that\nclergyman in American history, taking the wind completely out of his sails, till he seems\nto dread the old Captain, as the fly dreads the spider. One morning he forgot his manners,\nand rudely replied that he did not want American history rammed down his throat.\nWhereupon the old Captain deftly but quietly hopped over to England, then to China and\nmade the poor clergyman\u2019s discomfiture complete. The English man comes to table,\nfidgets around, but sooner or later the little captain\u2019s bright eye, and that solemn\nforefinger of his begin their work, and alas, for Johnny Bull. There are five or six men\nwho seem to me scaly. They afiliate with each other and evenings gamble in the card\nroom, which contains the bar. As the days pass on we speak and are spoken to by most of\nthe passengers, who seem to like us, but the Chandlers and we, with Mr. Blelock and the\nold Captain, who is an odd one, one by himself, perhaps I should say the Chandlers and\nwe seem to naturally come together. Mrs. Chandler is the \u201cornament\u201d of the company I\nthink, and her husband is apparently proud of, and devoted to her. She told me in\nconfidence that he is a Meth. clergyman, but he came on board as Mr. Chandler, and no\none suspects his calling. He wished to travel in perfect freedom like any other man, and\nis often amused to hear the surmises as to whether there are any clergymen aboard, and\nwho they are.",

    "text": "September\nLast evening the concert was held in the saloon, presided over by Lord\nPorchester, not with that dignity a more earnest character would have shown. He was also\ncalled upon for a song, and accompanying himself upon the piano, sang a silly little thing\ncalled \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d and lisping out the words in quite a childish manner. Of course it was\ncheered. The singing did not amount to anything but helped to vary the monotony of the\nvoyage. The Surgeon asked Frederick to move a vote of thanks to the Lord, which he\ndid. After the concert Lord Porchester was introduced to us, and in a remark or two\nshowed, I thought, a possibility of there being something to him after all. Mrs. Chandler\nis growing quite animated over the prospect of reaching Queenstown, where they land to\nmake a short trip through Ireland before meeting Dr. Vincent in London. The young\nEnglishmen turn out rather common people, I think, and while there seem to be nice\npeople among the passengers, there are few I should care to \u201ctie to.\u201d In a day we all go\nour several ways. Whither? More porpoises have been gambolling around, and the old\nCaptain says they jump out of the water to breathe. They look like good sized fish,\nleaping forward out of the water like this\nalways leaping the old Capt. affirms,\ntoward the wind, so by them the sailors can tell the direction of the wind. They are a\nwarm blooded animal, and when they do not jump, come to the surface and stick their\nnoses out to breathe. To day I went down into the bowels of the deep, into the hold, no,\nbelow the hold, into the very bottom of this huge ship, where are the furnaces and the\nboilers and the machinery. I have been dreading going down, for one little lady who went\ndown said it was a dreadful place and that she ruined a dress by going, and Mr. Blelock,\nwho went down yesterday & who ruined a pair of pants, said nothing would induce him\nto go down again, that when he got off in the end of the ship, way under water, he would\nhave given ten dollars to be up out of that frightful place. I was a little inclined to take\ndescription for experience, but feeling I might always be sorry I had not seen for myself,\nand Mr. Blelock offering to show me where they went down, and while looking one of\nthat inferno\u2019s genii happening up and offering to conduct me, I thought it too good a\nchance, and running back and taking off my dress skirt and pinning around me a carriage\nlap cover in which we brought our deck blankets, put on my cloak which I left at the\nentrance in Mr. Blelock\u2019s hands, who waited for me, and followed my sooty guide. Down\nwe went three flights of iron steps, to where the ponderous machinery was clacking, to\nwhere the dynamo was manufacturing the electric lighting of the ship, where hung the\nelectric dial in communication with the Capt. on the bridge, over the deck, away through\na narrow aperture to the stem of the ship, where the guide pointing to the copper slanting\nside said \u201cThere is the skin of the ship!\u201d There must have been the spot that gave Mr.\nBlelock the terror, and had I allowed my imagination full scope I might have easily been\nterrified. But I have kept a watchful restraint over it all the voyage and therefore escaped\na natural terror. Then back past the mighty working levers to the huge furnaces 63 in\nnumber in nine rows of 7 each, with the sooty fireman stripped to the waist, opening and\nclosing those firery maws. Each furnace is surmounted by a huge boiler, like the boiler of\na locomotive, and down the middle of this row there was a little path between leading to\nthe tier beyond. Through it we went the boilers so near each other it seemed as if the hair\nwould be burned from our heads, but we came out in safety, and turning with a cheerful\ngood bye to these toiling attendants who could have stopped us in mid-ocean had they\nchosen, I followed my guide into the upper air, rewarded him with a bit of silvers\ndonned my coat, and the thing was done.\nNo wonder the poor fireman died, how they could ever get him up those circular\nstairs without killing him I do not see, and the stifling air of those furnaces would have\nended him had he staid below.",

I do not, but by all means prefer the Traits,\nthough I am glad to know all Mr. White tells us. About 2 or three o\u2019clock we sighted land\nat first like a cloud resting on the horizon, which at sea seems much nearer than one\nwould suppose. This filmy outline gradually assumed tangibility and towards night we\ncame directly across the rocky, dreary, barren coast of Kerrys. At last upon a stretch of\nmountain side we descried numerous little huts clinging for dear life apparently, while the\nbarren mountain side itself was seamed with dark lines which marked the stone walls by\nwhich it was divided. \u201cPoor, barefooted Ireland\u201d exclaimed Frederick gazing sadly upon\nthose shores he first saw forty one years ago. \"Rich in wit, but poor in wisdom!\u201d The\nwind was fresh but these shores were so facinating that I stayed out in the cold watching\nthem, as long as we could see. About o\u2019clock we neared Queenstown, and Mrs.\nChandler\u2019s eyes brightened as she looked forward to putting her foot again on solid land,\nand bidding good bye to sea sickness. She even grew merry in anticipation and gladly\ncame forth from her state room in coat and a very dressy little befeathered hat, and with a\nfew others awaited the transferring to a steaming boat that came alongside. We said good\nbye and from the upper deck watched the transfer. Our great steamer seemed solid and\nimmovable, while the little tug or whatever it was bobbed up and down, now mounting\nup as if it would come to the upper deck & then sinking down again into the darkness.\nAfter the luggage was safely deposited, the passengers filed over, and I could not help\nbeing amused to see Mrs. Chandler meekly filing over with the rest, like a poor little\nmartyr, her triumphant air all vanished. The plank was withdrawn, the bobbing lights\nmoved off, they were introduced to the old world through Queenstown and we steamed\non our way toward Liverpool. There has been one little baby, the son of a young Dr.\nBrown from IIls. going to study in London,\u201d and a youngster of 31 yrs I believe, who\nwith his mother, English, are going back to Yorkshire to see \u201cGrandma.\u201d He is a sturdy\nwell behaved little fellow, and sits opposite us at table. Mr. Blelock says the old Capt.\nsteams up in the afternoon & by 3 o\u2019clock feels quite happy. How I do hate the stuffy\nstate rooms at night. We have had to have the port hole closed for two or three nights\npast, as the sea has been high, and the water is dashed against the port hole with\nconsiderable violence. The long plunging motion of the vessel, dipping her bows beneath\nthe waves, then rising, rising, till she turns to plunge again, is to me the most unpleasant.\nThe top of the head seems to fly off.\nI forgot to mention Fastnet light, signalled before dark a tower that reminded me\nof Sankaty Head tower in Nantucket but perched on a single bold rock rising up from\nthe sea as if for the express purpose of upholding that light to mariners.",

    "text": "September\nEarly this morning the noble coast of Wales came in sight. Bold in outline it is at\nthe same time cheerful, and not like the sad dreary Kerry coast, but to me the Kerry rocks\nwere quite as interesting. Ireland is no longer in sight. Wales absorbs the attention. But\nthe clouds veil Snowdon, and in vain we stretch our gaze for a sight of this highest land\nin Great Britain. We saw cottages here also but not such dreary little huts as the Irish.\nThey were white and the hill sides looked as if they might have good grass, while the\nIrish mountain sides seemed barely covered with a thin mossy looking skin of dull green.\nWe steamed past Anglesee\nwishing we might but get sight of the tubular bridge, of\ncourse impossible, and were at last compelled to take another lunch on board. Then a low\nlying shore became visible, and this was old England. Then we began to have a stretch of\nland upon both sides of us, and finally as we came in site of Liverpool the tide being out\nthe City of Rome dropped anchor two clumsy dirty sort of ferry boats with no cabin\nsteamed up alongside, one at the bow for cabin passengers, one at the stem for steerage\npassengers, and thus we sailed up the Mersey to Liverpool, the great seaport which now\nhas 1/3 the foreign trade of Great Britain. On our way we met the Manx Steamer for the\nIsle of Man, with the arms of that Island upon its side\nsomething\nafter this fashion. Soon the Snaefell, from Douglass, Isle of Man, passed us carrying a\ncrowded deck into Liverpool. These steamers are said to make 21 miles an hour. Soon we\npassed Birkenhead on our right, occupying what seemed a natural hill side, an outskirt\napparently of Liverpool between which and the city lie a very few of the many wonderful\ndocks that are the pride and glory of Liverpool.\nWith my first step on the landing stage, I said to myself, \u201cEngland,\u201d and passed\non through a file of porters or some sort of pleasant looking official in uniform holding in\ntheir hands a what seemed a red morrocco flat book with \u201cMidland\u201d in large gilt letters\non the outside where all could see. I suppose the other Roads were also represented.\nWhile waiting for Frederick to see to the luggage one of our passengers had his bag and\nbox poked over right before my eyes which I turned away while a group of men\nwatched the proceedings with all that curiosity which is said to belong especially to\nwoman. When our traps were collected, the trunk only was merely opened by raising\nthe lid, locking again, while upon all the official clapped his ticket, and we departed with\nthem. Before this however, Frederick had been accosted by a young man from Ohio,\nfresh and ruddy as an Englishman. Yankee Doodle is every where. We had upon the tug\nbade adieu to our friend the old Captain, whose last story was that he once started out\nfrom Liverpool in company with five other ships, that down and out aways a storm arose,\nand his was the only ship that rode through the gale and crossed the Atlantic. One went\nashore on the Welsh coast, one put in to Milford Haven, I believe, and three returned\ndisabled to Liverpool. May we sometime meet again. We took a cab, on to the top of\nwhich they bounced our heavy trunk, it seemed as if it must come through on to my head,\nit was before Frederick got in, and away we went to a private hotel reccomended by a\nsteward of the City of Rome. A dubious looking place when we got to it. Two men\npanted upstairs with the trunk, but before I got it more than unlocked, in came Frederick\nwho meantime had found another place, and up came two more men to pant down stairs\nagain and around the corner to a plain but neat house on Lord Nelson St. where we have\ntaken up our aboad for the time we stay in Liverpool. The girl who waits upon us, Nelly,\nis a chubby pretty, honest, little girl of 16 or 18 yrs. I should think and very capable. Our\ndinner, we eat alone, seemed quite as if taken from a story. We had the traditional chops,\nand they were sweet and good.\nIn the evening we went out for a walk. We are only two blocks from St. George\u2019s\nHall one of or the principle building in the city, containing an organ said to be the largest\nin England.\u00b0 In St. George\u2019s Hall are held the Sessions, or Criminal Court.\u201d Concerts\nare also held in the Hall.\u201c It is approached through a sort of square surrounded by posts\nand an iron chain low enough to step over, two great portals of stone, i e,\na stone block on each side, surmounted by a crouching lion, making 4 lions. Within the\nrailing & on the square, on pedastals, are Prince Albert at one end and the Queen at the\nother,\u201d on horseback while in middle between the two is a large statue upon a pedastal of\nLord Beaconsfield. It was only the common and the lower classes on the street where\nwe walked in the evening, but little begrimed children in tatters, and great bare-legged,\nbare-headed girls, were hurried along the crowd. The faces of many are tolerably cheerful\nbut not happy in expression. Life is certainly a struggle here.",

Rode on train to Pier & back. In P.M. walked\nout again up London Road meeting the surging crowd seeing the poor children\nbegrimed & in tatters, little barefooted, ragged boys running after the train cars, turning\ncart wheels in the hope of having a penny thrown them. Met a strange foreigner, hatless\n& with some sort of covering thrown around his lithe body, hurrying as if pursued. In\nevening again walked down Lime St, seeing the same or a similar crowd back across\nthe sq in front of St. George\u2019s Hall & to our room. Our meals are served to only\nourselves, at any hour we designate. Nellie who waits upon us is a bright pretty girl from\nYorkshire.\nO, the misery that cruely abides in this city.

Our landlady avers that many of them are in\nthe street with very likely drunken mothers at home that this town is second only to\nGlasgow in the amount of drunkenness among women.",

Just before entering we met a pretty girl from Vienna, Aus. a Hungarian who\nhad charge of a glass stand, of Bohemian glass. She had been in the U.S. and liked\nAmerica much. As it was raining when we came out, took a hansom. After dinner walked\nout a little again to a store in London Road, bought some paper & envelopes & photo of a\nRev. Brown whom Frederick saw here before but who died about 2 or 3 months ago.",

Frederick purchased his photograph, and\nthis morning instead of going to church we walked for an hour & a half going down Lime\nSt. & around by Abercromby Sq. into the London Road home. People will look at\nFrederick wherever we go, but they wear no unpleasant expression. Many have a decided\nappearance of interest. In the evening we walked up to Pemberton Place and entered a\nBaptist church. The minister preached from the text in Genesis, Come in thou blessed\nof the Lord. Why stand ye without? A plain, practical, earnest sermon. His pulpit, some\nlike those in Cath. churches stood up by itself around the edge of a sq platform\nsurrounding it a row of little boys led by a man in singing each boy holding a book by\nhimself & singing away like little angels, I hope. After the sermon the minister descended\nunseen, and in the rear baptized two persons.",

Then on Lime St took a hansom to Great Eastern pier where\nwe went aboard a clumsy crowded boat that took us down past some of the wonderful\ndocks, by some ship yards past some war vessels to the Great Easter, used now as a\nshow for shows & advertisements. An immense vessel. Lunched on board, then\ndescended with a crowd to the great compartment in which was conveyed the cable,\nwhich is now used as a theater & saw the plays that interested the audience. On the boat\ngoing out to the Great Eastern, Frederick saw some girls take out their whisky bottle, &\nwe saw a man & wife sit down with lunch & bottle.\nWednesday, September 30 1886\nFrom Lime St. Station took my first R.R. ride in Old England, through lovely,\nquiet landscapes, beautiful fields enclosed by trim hedge rows, to old Chester. At depot\nmet a Miss Mason, American, been in Chester 2 weeks, abroad 5 yrs, was homesick,\nawaiting the cars to London & going home at once. Took a car top ride through town, to\nend of route & back to East Gate. Visited the old Cathedral, my first. The organ was\npealing through the vaulted isles as we entered & the voice of the clergyman reading the\nservice in the distant choir sounded weird enough. The choristers too, filing out beyond\nthe columns & the great marble tomb, and at last disappearing in the distance, was a\npicture not to be forgotten. The whole experience was one to be remembered. It was only\nmarred by my feeling I had not sufficient time for it. Saw an American from Chicago\nthere, in a hurry. Spent the day in walking around the walls, mounting the towers visiting\nthe Rows,2 where poor Frederick became too tired to continue, returned to the depot & I\ncontinued through some of the old streets, took a car & joined him. Eaton Hall unhappily\nfor us closed.",

But the tickets would not admit of stopping & we\ncame on unannounced to Mrs. Crofts, in St. Neots, a quaint little English town hidden\naway from the R.R. station, built of a yellowish stone, opening immediately onto the\nnarrow sts that seems more like lanes than a sts, of 4000 inhabitants and no newspaper. It\nseems the queerest little place possible. The houses, I should call them cottages, are low,\nand as I said open directly upon a cobble stone side walk, on the roadway itself. Coming\nfrom Liverpool we passed through beautiful landscapes, hedgerows, fields cultivated like\ngardens, and what appeared almost perfect country roads, clean as if swept by a broom,\nand not a single person riding upon them. We came between some barren mountain\ntops, I think in southern Yorkshire, & first we knew ran through a tunnel coming out\nupon another landscape and running quite away from the rain. We passed in the\nvicinity of the underground palace of the late Duke of Portland.\nWe passed through two long tunnels, one of which was a 5 minutes tunnel. A nice\nlittle English woman & two children got out at for their home, a great plum\nregion. She had been very kind in pointing out and describing, and we were sorry for\nher to go. Afterwards a ruddy young Englishman & a rather sickly looking man got in,\nthe latter from Natal, but English born. At the Cross St. Neots, Mrs. Crofts met us\nwith open arms. We had tea, went to bed in a cosy chamber and I spent my first night in a\nreal English home, feeling how surely walls can open from a very common outside to the\nmost cheerful and elegant hearthstones, shut away entirely from the world."

Breakfast 8. dinner 1. tea 4. supper 8. everlasting eating, but\nnot much at a time, which is after all perhaps, the better way. After dinner, a donkeyish\nwith Frederick driving, took us to Buckden,\nlooking diminutive horse & I think a fly,\nan old coaching town, to the Towers, the palace in which Catherine of Arragon spent\nsome time before going to Kimbolton where she died. Adjoining was the old parish\nchurch, in the church yard of which were the graves of two of her nephews, who being at\nCambridge & the sweating sickness breaking out, she brought them to Buckden, where\nthe unfortunate youths sickened & died. We took tea at the the old coaching inn of the\ntown, which being one of the halting places on the old road from London to York had\nseen many a mery bout of bluff Old Harry\u2019s merry men. The road thence was\nbeautiful as no other than English roads I believe can be, but, beautiful as it is, this part of\nthe country depresses me by its flatness. I rather some elevation if bleak. We ambled\nhome, much amused by our little beastie, who in the midst of a very respectable trot\nwould suddenly almost stop as if overcome by sudden weakness, then after a proper\ninterval jog on again."

The hour, 5 P.M. the slim wax tapers, the fading day light coming\nthrough the grand painted windows, the noble organ, the magnificent anthem, the solemn\nechoing of the vaulted roof, the silent listeners, the beautiful singing, all made it an hour\nto be ever remembered.\nWe, the trio, went back to the hotel for our tea & thereby\nnearly lost our train, the waiters assuring us the omnibus would be around in time, &\neven when nearly time for train to start calmly asserting there was time enough. We\nfinally left them entirely, secured a carriage & reached our train, & left all the glories of\nCambridge behind us, to be treasured in memory forever."
